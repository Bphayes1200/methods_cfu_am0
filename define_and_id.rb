# Run each line of code below (either from this file or in IRB individually).
#  Then, in a ruby comment, write 1-2 sentences describing what is happening, using ALL the involved vocabulary terms you've learned in this lesson so far.

# EXAMPLE
# The downcase method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed; downcase has one clear job which is to lowercase all letters that exist in the String
# The return value is "hello world"
"Hello World".downcase

# YOU DO the rest:


"Hello World".include?("Hello")
# The include? method is being called on the string object "Hello World". The argument "Hello" is passed through the include? method. 
# The return value is true

"Hello World".end_with?("Hello")
# The end_with? method is being called on the string object "Hello World". The arguement "Hello" is being passed through the end_with? method. 
# The return value is false

"Hello World".end_with?("rld")
# the method end_with is being called on the string object "Hello World". The arguement "rld" is being passed through the end_with? method.
# the return value is true

12.even?
# The even? method is not being called upon an object. There are no arguements.
# The return value will be a syntax error

18.next
# The next method is not being called on an object. There are no arguements. 
# The return value will be a syntax error.
